# Projects

The following contain examples of projects that I have completed while pursuing my degree


## Happieness Project


The following project used real data to predict happieness scores across multiple countries based on variables such as location, genorosity, freedom and trust in government. 
This Data Predicitcve Analysis was completed using Tableau: [Average Happiness Model Predictors2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91151009/139950483-3bb0039d-7636-4209-8776-0e804e4447ff.png)

Through this data, I was able to predict and come to the conclusion that happiness is dependent on the generosity in one's country along with the trust, or lack thereof in the government. This could lead to a business decision by the Government of a nation to promote trust or generosity to lead to increased happiness throughout the country, promoting mental health.
